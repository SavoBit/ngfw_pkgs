YOU MUST use this iptables exec to get the DIVERT options.

to build by hand:

set KERNEL_DIR to the netcap kernel source dir
#make KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/kernel/dmorris/linux-2.6.2-netcap/ NO_SHARED_LIBS=1
make KERNEL_DIR=/space/kernel/kpkg/2.6.16-ck11/linux-2.6.16-ck11-prod/ NO_SHARED_LIBS=1


to build package:
go into the debian iptables source dir
fakeroot debian/rules binary
you may need to change the KERNEL_DIR in debian/rules at the top


I modified the debian packaging in the following ways:

changed the make rules to the 2.6 kernel_dir, and statically compiled
changed iptables to iptables-mv
substed iptables-1.2.9.tar.bz2 to the patched .bz2
made iptables-mv provide iptables (and same for -dev)
