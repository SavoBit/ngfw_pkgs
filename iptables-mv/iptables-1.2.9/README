iptables has numerous upstream sources used to create the actual
Debian package. All of those pristine sources are in the upstream
subdirectory of this archive. The linux kernel sources have been
pruned down to just the COPYRIGHT, MAINTAINER, and CREDITS files
along with netfilter directories.

To unpack and prepare everything, use this command:

  debian/rules prep

Select patch-o-matic patches are applied to the kernel source tree
that is unpacked into debian/build; however, the kernel source trees
used to build the iptables packages are absolutely NOT left in a
state intended for any particular use beyond the iptables package
build.
