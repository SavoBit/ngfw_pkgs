untangle-spamassassin (3.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This is a new upstream release containing mostly bug fixes. The
  largest change is the inclusion of a (fixed) script called sa-update
  that can be used to download the latest rules from upstream. To use
  it run sa-update as root. In the future, this may, by default, run
  from a cron job automatically, but in the interim it is a manual
  process.

untangle-spamassassin (3.1.0a-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This is a new major upstream release with many new
  features. Detailed information on the upgrade is available in
  /usr/share/doc/untangle-spamassassin/UPGRADE.gz. The most important changes
  are documented here. If you have made local configuration changes,
  you will probably want to read that documentation to ensure you
  configuration is still correct.

  DCC and Razor support have been disabled by default, since they are
  no longer free for non-personal use. To re-enable them, edit
  /etc/untangle-spamassassin/v310.pre

  More Bayes storage modules have been added. The default, using
  perl's DB_File module, is the slowest. You may wish to switch to the
  SDBM storage module (uses perl's SDBM_File module). If you are
  currently using the SQL module, you may wish to switch to using the
  MySQL or PgSQL modules. To switch storage modules, follow the steps
  listed in the "MIGRATION" section of the sa-learn(1) man page.

  Spamd and spamc now support Bayes learning, if the --allow-tell or
  -l option is given to spamd. Please note that there may be security
  implications with enabling this option. (Command line options to
  spamd are changed in /etc/default/untangle-spamassassin)
