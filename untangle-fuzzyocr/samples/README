These eml files are sample spam emails to test your installation of FuzzyOCR. Assuming you are using the default settings, the output you get should match the output listed here.

Use spamassassin -t < samplefile.eml to test :)

corrupted-gif.eml: Contains a corrupted gif image, additionally I changed the content-type to jpeg, so the output should show:
