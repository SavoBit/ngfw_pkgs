Ruby daemons for Debian
-----------------------

This package provides daemons libraries for ruby and a proxy
for the older libdaemonize-ruby, so applications that
were using libdaemonize-ruby can switch to libdaemons-ruby 
without any code change.

This proxy file will be dropped after lenny release, so newer
applications shall require 'daemons/daemonize' besides 'daemonize'.
