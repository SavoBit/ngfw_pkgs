----------------------

This is Debian package of untangle-gocr.
Please, read README*

Actually database is for developing purpouses only, so if you a user, you
don't need them. If you are a develper you know what do with them.

Examples will be installed in /usr/share/untangle-gocr/examples if compiled.
