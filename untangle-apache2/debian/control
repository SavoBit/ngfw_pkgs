Description: next generation, scalable, extendable web server
 Apache v2 is the next generation of the omnipresent Apache web server. This
 version - a total rewrite - introduces many new improvements, such as 
 threading, a new API, IPv6 support, request/response filtering, and more.
 .
 It is also considerably faster, and can be easily extended to provide services
 other than http.
 .
 This package contains all the standard untangle-apache2 modules, including SSL support.
 However, it does *not* include the server itself; for this you need to 
 install one of the untangle-apache2-mpm-* packages; such as worker or prefork.

Description: utility programs for webservers
 Provides some add-on programs useful for any webserver.  These include:
  - ab (Apache benchmark tool)
  - logresolve (Resolve IP addresses to hostname in logfiles)
  - htpasswd (Manipulate basic authentication files)
  - htdigest (Manipulate digest authentication files)
  - dbmmanage (Manipulate basic authentication files in DBM format, using perl)
  - htdbm (Manipulate basic authentication files in DBM format, using APR)
  - rotatelogs (Periodically stop writing to a logfile and open a new one)
  - split-logfile (Split a single log including multiple vhosts)
  - checkgid (Checks whether the caller can setgid to the specified group)
  - check_forensic (Extract mod_log_forensic output from apache log files)

Description: high speed threaded model for Apache2
 The worker MPM provides a threaded implementation for Apache2. It is
 considerably faster than the traditional model, and is the recommended MPM.
 .
 Worker generally is a good choice for high-traffic servers because it
 has a smaller memory footprint than the prefork MPM.

Package: untangle-apache2-mpm-threadpool
Architecture: all
Depends: untangle-apache2-mpm-worker (= ${Source-Version})
Description: experimental high speed model for Apache2 (transitional package)
 This package exists for the sole purpose of easing upgrades for threadpool
 users of Ubuntu 4.10 (warty) or Debian testing who are upgrading to the newer
 Debian 3.1 (sarge) or Ubuntu 5.04 (hoary).  Once this package has successfully
 pulled in untangle-apache2-mpm-worker and configured it as a replacement, it can be
 safely removed.

Conflicts: untangle-apache2-mpm-worker, untangle-apache2-mpm-prefork, untangle-apache2-mpm-threadpool
Description: experimental high speed perchild threaded model for Apache2
 Perchild is the grown up, mac daddy version of suexec for untangle-apache2. Rather than
 execute a cgi script as a given user, perchild forks a process for each vhost,
 then su's to the correct user/group for that vhost.
 .
 Each process then uses a thread model similar to that of the worker mpm.
 .
 THIS MPM IS NOT CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO WORK CORRECTLY, IF AT ALL. IT IS UNDER 
 VERY HEAVY DEVELOPMENT.
 This mpm is still highly experimental, and should be used with care.

Conflicts: untangle-apache2-mpm-worker, untangle-apache2-mpm-threadpool, untangle-apache2-mpm-perchild
Description: traditional model for Apache2
 This Multi-Processing Module (MPM) implements a non-threaded,
 pre-forking web server that handles requests in a manner similar to
 Apache 1.3. It is appropriate for sites that need to avoid threading for
 compatibility with non-thread-safe libraries. It is also the best MPM
 for isolating each request, so that a problem with a single request will
 not affect any other.
 .
 It is not as fast, but is considered to be more stable.

 environment, ie for PHP4.
