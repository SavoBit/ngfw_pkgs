Description: next generation, scalable, extendable web server
 Apache v2 is the next generation of the omnipresent Apache web server. This
 version - a total rewrite - introduces many new improvements, such as 
 threading, a new API, IPv6 support, request/response filtering, and more.
 .
 It is also considerably faster, and can be easily extended to provide services
 other than http.
 .
 This package contains all the standard apache2 modules, including SSL support.
 However, it does *not* include the server itself; for this you need to 
 install one of the apache2-mpm-* packages; such as worker or prefork.
