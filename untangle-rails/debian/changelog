rails (1.2.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * We cannot remove the link vendor/rails, but we can point it so it
    is not recursive. Recursive links seem to break eclipse and lack
    of vendor/rails breaks rails. 
    The link target will create a non-recursive link, but a rails
    deployment that copies the rails directories will still contain
    recursive symlink. The problem is really in Eclipse though. It
    should handle recursive symlinks.
